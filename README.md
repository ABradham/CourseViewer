## About CourseViewer

CourseViewer is a web application and SMS service meant to help Dartmouth College students get enrolled into the classes they want.

All too often, trying to get enrolled into a packed class during add/drop period comes down to manually checking the registrar's webpage every 5 minutes and hoping that a seat has become available. CourseViewer automates this process, so you can be the first to know when a seat opens in your desired class.

After entering your phone number and the CRNs for the classes you'd like to register for on the CourseViewer website, CourseViewer starts continually checking the registrar's webpage for enrollment changes. When a class you want to apply for has an open seat, **CourseViewer sends you a text message** letting you know.

It's that simple: **Sign up, get notified.**
